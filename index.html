	<p class = "massage-desc-1"> Carolina Thai Healing Arts offers professional 		Thai massage, Cupping <br> massage therapy, 		
   Acupressure, Reflexology, and our signature East 		meets <br> West massage. <br> <br>

	Experience the deep relaxation and healing that a 	Thai massage will bring <br> into your life. This 	
  ancient healing art from Thailand is performed on a 
  <br> comfortable floor mat while fully clothed. 	
  Sometimes we use hand crafted <br> herbal compresses, 
  traditional balms, liniments or cups to release 
  areas of <br> pain and congestion. <br><br>

	Energy lines (Sen in Thai, similar to meridians in 	 Chinese medicine) are <br> unblocked and soothed, joints 	 are moved through their range of motions <br> and 	
  muscle tension is released with rhythmic 
  compression, stretching and <br> rocking motions. Thai 
  massage is truly a unique and wondrous therapeutic <br> 	 art. 
  </p>

	<p class = "massage-desc-2"> 
    At Carolina Thai Healing Arts we also offer the 		unique East meets West <br> massage. We merge the flow 		of a Swedish massage combined with the <br>  deep 		
    therapeutic benefits of Eastern massage <br>
    techniques. The massage <br> will leave you feeling 
    relaxed, refreshed and calmly energized to move 
    with <br> grace through your day.<br><br>


    During this massage you will be draped in fresh 
    linen and an aromatic <br> blend of herbal oils will 
    be applied directly to your skin to sooth tired 
    <br> muscles and refresh your spirit. Varying degrees 
    of pressure will be applied <br> to pressure points 
   		 and sen (energy) lines and we may also include 
    <br>	stretches and range of motion to begin to remove 
    	tension and accumulated <br> tightness in your 
    	muscles. <br><br>


    	This massage includes the best of both Eastern 
    	and Western massage to <br> leave you relaxed and 
    	rejuvenated.
